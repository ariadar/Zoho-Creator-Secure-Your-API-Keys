<h1>Secure Your API Keys in Zoho Creator</h1>
The purpose of this script is to allow you to encrypt your API keys so they can be available to use in other forms & workflows, without exposting the API key in either the script, or to the user of the form.
<p><br> Step 1: Create a form called "API Keys"
<br> Step 2: In the 'API Keys' form, create two single line fields: "API Name" & "API Key"
<br> Step 3: Select the 'API Key' field, then enable data encrption in the form settings.

<p><br> Step 4: Now you can use this encrypted API key in any new form you create. In the new form, create another single line field, then use this script in your workflow to fetch the 'API Key' from you 'API Keys' form.
